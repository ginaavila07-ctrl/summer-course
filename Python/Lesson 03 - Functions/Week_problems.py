#Problem 1 — Pizza Party Planner
#You're organising a pizza party and need to figure out how many pizzas to order. Write a program that helps the host plan for any group size.

#Your task:

#Write a function pizzas_needed(people, slices_per_person, slices_per_pizza) that calculates and returns how many whole pizzas to order (always round up — you never want to run short!).
#Write another function leftover_slices(people, slices_per_person, slices_per_pizza that returns how many slices will be leftover.
#Use input statements to ask how many guests, slices per person, and slices per pizza.
#Using your user defined functions, print the PARTY SUMMARY shown below.

# import math
# party_size = int(input("How many guests are you feeding: "))
# slices_per_person = int(input("How many slice will each person get: "))
# pizza_slices = int(input("How many slices are in the pizza you are ording: "))


# def pizza_needed (size: int, slice: int, pizza_slice: int)-> int:
#     total_slices = size * slice
    
#     total_pizzas_needed = math.ceil(total_slices/ pizza_slice)
    
#     leftover_slices = (pizza_slice * total_pizzas_needed)- total_slices
    
#     padding_for_guest = math.ceil(total_slices * 1.20)
    
#     padding_pizza_count = math.ceil(padding_for_guest/pizza_slice)
    
#     return  total_pizzas_needed, total_slices, leftover_slices, padding_pizza_count

# total_pizzas_needed, total_slices,leftover_slices, padding_pizza_count = pizza_needed(party_size,slices_per_person,pizza_slices)

#Problem 3 — Drill Sergeant Fitness Test
#ATTENTION, RECRUIT! The Army Physical Fitness Test is underway. Your program will collect a soldier's performance data and report their results — no excuses accepted.

#Your task:

#Ask the soldier for their name and rank using input().
#Ask how many push-ups they completed and how long their 2-mile run took (in minutes).
#Print a formatted after-action report with their name, rank, and both scores. Also print the soldier's average pace per mile for the run.

#Problem 4 — Road Trip Fuel Calculator
#Write a program that helps a driver estimate the fuel cost for a road trip.

#Ask the user for:

#The distance of the trip in miles
#Their car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG)
#The current price of gas per gallon in dollars
#Calculate and print:

#The number of gallons needed (rounded to 2 decimal places)
#The total fuel cost (rounded to 2 decimal places)

#Aboard the ISS, oxygen levels must be continuously monitored. Write a simulation that tracks O2 levels and triggers alerts.

#Your task:

#Write a function o2_status(level) that returns:
#"CRITICAL" if level < 15
#"LOW" if level is 15–18
# "NORMAL" if level is 19–23
# "HIGH" if level > 23
# You are given the following hourly O2 readings (as a percentage):
# readings = [21, 20, 19, 17, 16, 14, 13, 15, 18, 21, 22, 21]
# Use a for loop to process each reading, call your function, and print the hour and status.
# Use conditionals to print an extra *** ALERT: TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY *** line whenever the status is CRITICAL.
# After the loop, print a summary: how many hours were spent in each status category.

#Problem 3 — RPG Character Battle 
# You're simulating a turn-based battle between a hero and a monster. 
# Each turn, the hero attacks the monster and then the monster strikes back — until one of them runs out of HP.

# Your task:

# Write a function attack(defender_hp, damage) that subtracts damage from defender HP and returns the new HP (minimum 0).
# Write a function is_alive(hp) that returns True if HP > 0.
# Use a while loop to simulate the battle. Each round:
# The hero deals 18 damage to the monster.
# If the monster is still alive, it deals 12 damage to the hero.
# Print the round number and both HP values after each exchange.
# End the loop when either combatant reaches 0 HP.
# Use conditionals after the loop to print who won.
# Starting values:

# hero_hp = 100
# monster_hp = 90
# Expected output (partial):

# === BATTLE START ===
# Round 1:  Hero HP: 88   |  Monster HP: 72
# Round 2:  Hero HP: 76   |  Monster HP: 54
# Round 3:  Hero HP: 64   |  Monster HP: 36
# ...
# HERO WINS! The monster has been defeated.
